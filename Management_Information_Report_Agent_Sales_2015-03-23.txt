Reporting Criteria
Dear BSP Participant,
Please be informed that the information contained in this report may be used to guide your individual
commercial decisions. The contents of the report should not be discussed with other Airlines or Agents
other than the Agent whose sales have triggered the report.
All amounts in this Report have been converted to USD using the IATA 5 day exchange rate.
Agents appearing in this report:
Agents with an average monthly sales for the last 12 months of 500,000.00 USD and above that have 100 % or
more sales variation (i.e. average daily sales for the reporting period have more than doubled as compared to the
average daily sales for the past year).
Note: The sales of Head Offices and of Branch locations within the same country have been consolidated under the
Head Office code.
Note: For the initial launch, when there is one or more Branches located in other countries that have sales as part
of the Agent group, the Agent group will be excluded from the Report. IATA will advise immediately when these
Agents become available.
The primary purpose of these reports is used for Agency Risk Management by IATA field offices working closely
with the regional hubs to support local engagement on potential risk to industry funds. These reports allow IATA to
identify Agents in each BSP with significant deviations in their sales amounts. These reports are to provide more
visibility on the Agent's financial situation and allow Airlines and IATA to react faster with this additional information,
therefore proactively safeguarding BSP Airlines' funds.
For enquiries please consult our Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section in Customer Portal. For further
information, please contact our Customer Support team at www.iata.org/customer
Report Period
The report period starts on the first day of sales to be remitted (first day after the previous remittance date) and
finishes two days before the Report is generated.
Countries not included in the Management Information Report
Israel is not included in the Management Information Reports due to the legal restrictions imposed by government
regulators.
The following countries: Brazil, China, Germany, Kosovo, Netherlands, Russia, Serbia, South Korea and Venezuela
are not included in the current report. IATA will advise as soon as reports for the BSPs in these countries become
available.
Financial Securities
Please be advised that group Financial Securities (defined as covering a number of Agents and having a maximum
amount which can be claimed per default and per market per year) include the following financial security types:
Default Insurance Programme, TAANZ, CWA Mutual Fund and Industry Trust Fund (Hong Kong). Please note that
the coverage of group Financial Securities does not equal the aggregated amount at risk of the Agents under the
Financial Security.
Financial securities with an unlimited coverage have not been disclosed and will not show a percentage utilization
of Financial Security. In the Report, the percentage of Financial Security and the Financial Security amount will
appear as an asterisk.
